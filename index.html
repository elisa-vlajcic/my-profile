			Elisa Vlajcic, 21, current Master student at <strong> HEC Paris</strong>.
			I'm from <strong> Belgium </strong> and did my bachelor studies at the Rotterdam School of Management (NL). Passionate about <strong> Marketing</strong>, I'm looking for my <strong> first internship, starting June 2021 </strong> ! üìù

			<h2>~ My international background ~</h2>
			<p> 
			The first thing I like to say to people when I meet them, is that despite being Belgian, I actually never lived there. Not even a day. Weird, right ? </p>
			<p> Both of my parents come from <strong> Belgium </strong>, which is why I was born there. However, at the time, they were living in <strong> Germany </strong>. I spent 8 years of my life there (in Bonn and a small village near Frankfurt), before moving to <strong> France </strong> (Lille, to be more precise). I graduated from an international High school before moving to the <strong> Netherlands </strong> for my Bachelor degree. I studied International Business Administration in Rotterdam, where I lived for 3 years. I was also lucky enough to go on exchange to <strong> Singapore </strong> for 5 months during my last Bachelor year. Since August, I'm back in France and living in the small (but cute) village of Jouy-en-Josas, (not so) near Paris. </p>
			<p> Oh yes, and did you notice my last name by the way ? I forgot to mention that since my grandparents on my Dad's side are from Croatia, I grew up immersed in the Slav culture. </p>
			<p> Hopefully, you were able to follow my journey. You now understand why it's so hard for me to answer the "where do you come from?" question !

			<h2>~ I like to say that I'm proactive ~</h2>
			<p> 
			Despite my strong strong focus on academics, I've always made sure to develop my interests through extra-curricular activities. Some of my early extra-curriculars were piano and music theory lessons, as well as Croatian language classes. In high school, I developed my interest for business through an <strong>entrepreneurship project</strong>. As a group of 15 students, we created the <strong>"Butter Stick"</strong>, a stick filled with butter to spread it more easily on pans and bread. This is the experience that triggered my interest for marketing and communication, because I was part of the team which had to develop the whole promotion strategy of our product (packaging, social media, sales strategy, etc).
			</p> 
			<p>
			I continued to develop my interests during my bachelor studies. I was a <strong>case solver at the RSM Case Society</strong>, a consultancy-oriented student organization which aimed to prepare students for international Case Competitions. Cases were between 3- to 24-hours long and were to be solved in teams of 4. I had the opportunity to be part of the team representing my university at the University of M√ºnster Case Competition (Germany) and the University of Washington Global Case Competition (USA). These were some of the most incredible and unique moments I experienced as a bachelor student ! Additionally, I was an <strong>ambassador for my bachelor program</strong> for two years. I advised and shared my experience with a loooooot of prospective students online as well as offline though campus tours, school visits and so called "student for a day" events, where prospective student came on campus to experience the program for a day. I also shared my experience during Open days during live Q&As and presentations in front of hundreds of parents and students. These experiences strongly developed my communication and public speaking skills. Finally, I was selected to be part of the <strong>RSM Honors program</strong>, a year-long course where we were taught everything about Silicon Valley as an entrepreneurship cluster. The highlight of the experience was the 10-day Silicon Valley trip, which was a unique opportunity to visit companies and various Bay area stakeholders, like Stanford, UC Berkeley, Dropbox, Google, Robinhood, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			Today, at HEC, I'm part of the <strong>Promotion team of the HEC Business Game</strong>, an annual case competition event that brings together hundreds of talented students from around the world on the HEC campus. Our role is to make sure that as many students as possible register to the event, through social media promotion and directly contacting relevant parties.

			<h2>~ Other things I love ~</h2>
			<p> 
			I'm passionate about <strong>DIYs and crafts</strong> and always curious to <strong>learn about new ways to develop my creativity</strong> (video, photography, hand-made jewelry, I tried them all) ! </p>
			<p>Another passion of mine is <strong>Baking, and Food</strong> in general. I guess you can call me foodie. Some of my specialties are Daim bar cake (special type of chocolate caramel) and cheesecake. I'm also pretty good at making pancakes and banana bread. And when I'm not making the food myself, I'm always on the look for new restaurants and caf√©s to try out with friends (Brunch is definitely my all-time favorite meal!).
